# Editing #

Our folder structure follows the following convention: Under `src/app`, you will find several folders. `services`, `templates` and `components` are special. `services` contains all the angular services that are common to views and contain business logic. `templates` contains simple partial templates and `components` contains 3rd party modules. The rest of the folders contain all files for each view separately.

# Translations #

Translations for templates have been provided through [angular-translate](http://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/guide). See link for guide on adding new languages. Translations data is curently in `services/translate.js`.
