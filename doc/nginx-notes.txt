To run this with nginx:

1) pip install uwsgi
2) sudo apt-get install nginx
2.5) python manage.py collectstatic
   - this collects your static files to /tmp/static/hisra (same as the default configuration in next step)
3) Configure hisra_server_nginx.conf
    - Set the media, static and location parameters to point to the right 
      location on your disk (this will be automated later)
    - NOTE: media directory needs to have permissions for www-data user to execute
            if it is inside your user home folder (eg /home/username/media) you might need to add user www-data to your username's group: gpasswd -a www-data username
3.5) Symlink hisra_server_nginx.conf with nginx:
      sudo ln -s /path/to/django/project/hisra_server_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
4) Restart nginx: sudo service nginx restart
    - This will read the configuration of step 3
    - Check /var/log/nginx/error.log for errors
5) Run ./nginx_start.sh
    - This will start uwsgi with the django project
    - Check if the server is running using the browser: localhost:8000

Problems:
Check /var/log/nginx/error.log for nginx errors
Many problems are caused by permission issues. The nginx process needs permission
to read and write the socket file (see the static file location in
hisra_server_nginx.conf line 3 and nginx_start.sh). The nginx process also
needs permission to read static files (see the static file directory in
hisra_server_nginx.conf line 24 and hisra_server/settings.py lines 143-144)
