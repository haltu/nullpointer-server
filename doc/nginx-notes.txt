To run this with nginx:

1) pip install uwsgi
2) sudo apt-get install nginx
3) Configure hisra_server_nginx.conf
    - Set the media, static and location parameters to point to the right
      location on your disk (this will be automated later)
4) Restart nginx: sudo service nginx restart
    - This will read the configuration of step 3
    - Check /var/log/nginx/error.log for errors
5) Run ./nginx_start.sh
    - This will start uwsgi with the django project
    - Check if the server is running using the browser: localhost:8000

Problems:
Check /var/log/nginx/error.log for nginx errors
Many problems are caused by permission issues. The nginx process needs permission
to read and write the socket file (see the static file location in
hisra_server_nginx.conf line 3 and nginx_start.sh). The nginx process also
needs permission to read static files (see the static file directory in
hisra_server_nginx.conf line 24 and hisra_server/settings.py lines 143-144)
