This document describes the most basic configuration changes needed to get the
frontend and backend to work. For a more expansive installation instruction, see
install-instructions.txt.

-------
Backend
-------
The configuration of the backend consists of the following files:

hisra_server/settings.py:
  This is a regular Django settings file. The following settings should be
  changed for a minimal working example.

  STATIC_ROOT: the path where static files are found on the disk
  STATIC_URL: the URL where the static files are stored on disk
  MEDIA_ROOT: the folder where files uploaded to the server are stored
  MEDIA_URL: the URL from where files uploaded to the server are served from
  ALLOWED_ORIGIN: the allowed origins set for CORS headers. This should be set
      to the origin of the web back end.

hisra_server_nginx_config.conf:
  This is the nginx configuration. The most important configurable items are:

  location /protected: set the 'alias' to point to the location where the media
      files are stored on disk (same location as MEDIA_ROOT in settings.py)
  location /static: set the 'alias' to point to the location where static files
      are stored on disk. (same as STATIC_ROOT in settings.py)
  location /: set 'include' to include the uwsgi_params file included in the
      repository.

--------
Frontend
--------
The only item to be configured in the front end is the 'BASE_URL' parameter in
the 'hisra_webapp/src/app/config.js' file. This should be set to point to the
backend server's URL, for example http://drajala.ddns.net:8000
